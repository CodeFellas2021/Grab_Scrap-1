# **_Circular economy/Circularity_**
### Every year, we produce 1.3 billion tonnes of waste, far more than what we could possibly recycle. This has resulted in environmental disasters such as marine pollution, soil degradation, and a lack of sustainable waste disposal process. The majority of our global economy is built on the [**_```take-make-waste```_**](#) model rather than circularity. Companies, corporations, governments, and individuals can embrace circularity by forming partnerships to consolidate and then circulate their recyclable garbage. Since circularity should not be limited to a single industry, we created this platform where individuals & vendors from all domains across India can connect and circulate waste for a better environment and sustainable future for us all.
